# mrpeek OHBM BrainHack 2020

Getting started:

- [install MRtrix3 from source](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/build_from_source.html)
- clone this repo and [set it up as a module](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips_and_tricks/external_modules.html)
- [build](https://www.mrtrix.org/developer-documentation/build_page.html) the command and test that it works
- familiarise yourself with the MRtrix3 codebase
  - start by reading the [main publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31473352/) as an introduction
  - using the [API documentation](https://www.mrtrix.org/developer-documentation/)
- learn about [sixel encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel)
  - figure out best tools to handle them, starting with [information on the wiki](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrpeek/wiki)
- take a look at the [project board](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrpeek/projects/1), and don't hesitate to add tasks, modify the existing ones, and take on those you feel ready to tackle!

# Committing code

- We encourage you to create your own branches, and commit _very_ often. Once you've made a coherent set of changes, however small, commit them to your branch. This will help keep track of the evolution of the code, and is great practice anyway.

- Once you have code that more or less does what it's supposed to do, don't hesitate to [push your branch to GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for it. 

- We have protected the master branch so that changes (pull requests) require [review before merging](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests). This is probably not required for a small project like this, but it's a great way to ensure your changes are noticed by the other contributors and discussed if needed. It's also how things are likely to be done on any reasonable size project, so it's a good idea to get used to the process. 

- Make sure you communicate with us and most importantly with each other. Don't hesitate to discuss on the Mattermost channel, document issues / features required on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrpeek/issues) and/or [project board](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrpeek/projects/1), and engage via the video channel. Collaborative projects require a _lot_ more discussion and coordination than you might expect!

- Above all, have fun and experiment with the code! It's the best way to learn.
